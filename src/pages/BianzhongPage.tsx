                For the museum exhibit project this semester, we decided to design an exhibition that display an ancient Chinese musical instrument. In many cultures around the world, music and instrument plays an essential role in societal, political and economic development, they symbolize historical progress and human wisdom during a particular period of time. However, most museum exhibition only displays artifacts <strong>behind the showcase</strong>, with <strong>lengthy contextual description</strong>, which is not only <strong>lack of interaction</strong>, but also <strong>difficult for visitors to draw connection</strong> between the artifact and the corresponding historical event. Thus, we decide to design an interactive user experience in the museum exhibition, combining the artifact with video, visual elements, which provides visitors with an unique experience to interact with the virtual instrument, be immersed into the exhibition, and take away personalized souvenirs.

                Though there are lots of great traditional Chinese instrument to be introduced to the world, we decide to choose Bianzhong (ancient Chinese chime bell) as our major exhibit, because it is a well-known envoy of Chinese culture, with a perfect combination of technology, science and music.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since its excavation in 1978, Bianzhong is under prior protection and currently on-display in Hubei Provincial Museum in Wuhan, China. As a national treasure, it has only been played 3 times since it was unearthed, the last time it was played is on the ceremony of Hong Kong Reunification in 1997. Thus, a great majority of visitors don't get a chance to play the instrument or learn about the history behind it effectively through interaction.

              <p>
                The Bianzhong a perfect exhibit because it is relatively <strong>easy to learn</strong> how to play (strike with hammer), and the sound lasts long enough so that visitors have adequate time to <strong>adapt</strong> and find the right position to strike. Hence, we have got an inspiration from GarageBand in App Store China, which supports many traditional Chinese instruments like Erhu, Pipa, Guzheng, and we would like to build a similar interaction tool for worldwide visitors and music lovers, to play with the Bianzhong virtually.

Then, a natural transition will be made between introductions and its performance scene in both ancient and modern time, as well as its important role played in national events and culture exchanges. Last but not the least, a short demo will be shown of how our prototype will work in the exhibition.

                On the brochure, introductions are provided about the Bianzhong as well as Chinese ancient musical history and culture. There is also a blank space left for the QR code which records the audio a visitor has created. Once the visitor just played a part of music, it will be automatically be saved and printed out, leaving out a blank space at the top of the middle page. In this way, the brochure becomes unique for each visitor, which can be taken home as a souvenir, and play back the sound track of Bianzhong by extracting the QR code at anytime, in anywhere.

                As for the model, we decide to make a paper cardboard Bianzhong(shown in image at the bottom left). We select an image of partial Bianzhong, which is shown on paper and screen. We connected force sensor with wires connecting to the Arduino Uno Controller Board at one end, and sticked to the back of corresponding bell. In this way, once user presses a particular bell to play a tone, the position being pressed will be highlighted on the screen, and the sound will played(shown in image at the bottom right).
